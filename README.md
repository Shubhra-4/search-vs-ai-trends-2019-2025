# Search Engines vs AI Tools (2019–2025)
Excel-based analysis of global Search Engine Market Share (2019–2025) vs AI Tools popularity (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Bing AI). 

## Problem Statement
Search engine dominance has been stable for decades, but with the rise of generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Bing AI), user interest and search behavior might be shifting.  
This project explores:
- **How search engine market shares have evolved (2019–2025).**
- **How AI tools’ popularity trends compare with traditional search engines.**
- **Whether AI tools show potential to disrupt the search engine space.**

---

## Goal
1. To visualize long-term trends in **search engine market share**.  
2. To track **popularity of AI tools** using Google Trends index.  
3. To create clear, recruiter-friendly **dashboards** with minimal complexity.  
4. To derive actionable **insights** about the competition between search engines and AI tools.

---

## Logic & Approach
- Two datasets were prepared:
  1. **Search Engine Market Share (2019–2025)**  
     Monthly % share data for Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Others.  
  2. **AI Tools Popularity (2019–2025)**  
     Google Trends interest scores (0–100 scale) for ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Bing AI.  

- Process followed:
  1. **Data Cleaning**: Converted dates into Excel-readable format, ensured numeric consistency.  
  2. **Pivot Tables**:  
     - Summarized search engine shares by month.  
     - Summarized AI tools’ trends by month.  
  3. **Charts Created**:  
     - Line chart for **Search Engine Market Share Trend**.  
     - Line chart for **AI Tools Popularity Trend**.  

---

## Tech & Tools Used
- **Excel (PivotTables, Charts, Data Cleaning)**  
- **Google Trends (AI tools popularity dataset)**  
- **StatCounter / SimilarWeb (Search engine market share dataset)**  

No coding was used — **100% Excel-based workflow** for easy reproducibility.

---

## Dataset Source
- **Search Engines Share**: StatCounter Global Stats (2019–2025 snapshot).  
- **AI Tools Popularity**: Google Trends, Worldwide searches (2019–2025).  

---

## Visualizations
1. **Search Engine Market Share (2019–2025)**  
   - X-Axis: Date (Monthly, 2019–2025)  
   - Y-Axis: Market Share %  
   - Series: Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Other  

   Shows Google’s dominance (~90%) with Bing and others at very low single digits.  

2. **AI Tools Popularity Trend (2019–2025)**  
   - X-Axis: Date (Monthly, 2019–2025)  
   - Y-Axis: Popularity Index (0–100, Google Trends scale)  
   - Series: ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Bing AI  

   Shows ChatGPT’s explosive rise post-2022, dwarfing competitors.

---

## Interpretation
- **Search Engines**:  
  Google remains unchallenged with ~90% global market share. Bing and others show negligible growth despite years of competition.  

- **AI Tools**:  
  - ChatGPT skyrocketed in interest from late 2022, peaking in 2023–2024.  
  - Gemini and Perplexity show small but noticeable spikes (indicating niche adoption).  
  - Bing AI lags heavily despite being tied to Microsoft’s ecosystem.  

- **Cross Insight**:  
  While AI tools are gaining popularity in **curiosity/usage**, they are **not yet replacing search engines** in terms of market share. Instead, they coexist — users search for AI tools on Google itself.  

---

## Key Insights
1. Google is still **untouchable** in core search (~90%).  
2. AI tools (especially ChatGPT) have **captured user attention**, signaling **behavioral shift**.  
3. Gemini, Perplexity, Bing AI haven’t shown breakthrough adoption.  
4. **Recruiter takeaway**: This dashboard demonstrates ability to clean data, create pivot tables, visualize trends, and generate actionable business insights.  

---

## Results
- Created **2 clean, recruiter-ready dashboards** in Excel.  
- No extra clutter — only **essential charts** for maximum clarity.  
- Delivered **storytelling through visuals** → Google’s dominance + AI’s rising popularity.  

---

## Final Deliverables
- **Excel Workbook** with:
  1. `pivot_search` → Search Engine Market Share Trend (Line Chart)  
  2. `pivot_ai` → AI Tools Popularity Trend (Line Chart)  

- **Interpretation section** directly explains “what this means” for a business/recruiter.
